Drug Search and Tracker API
This is a Laravel-based API service designed for drug information search and user-specific medication tracking. It integrates with the National Library of Medicine's (NLM) RxNorm APIs to provide accurate drug data. The application features secure user authentication, a public search endpoint, and private endpoints for users to manage their personal medication lists.

‚ú® Features
Secure User Authentication: Register and Login endpoints using Laravel Sanctum for token-based authentication.

Public Drug Search: An unauthenticated endpoint to search for drugs using the RxNorm API.

Private Medication Tracking: Authenticated users can add, delete, and view drugs on their personal medication list.

External API Integration: A dedicated service class for clean and reusable communication with the RxNorm APIs.

Rate Limiting: The public search endpoint is rate-limited to prevent abuse and excessive requests.

API Caching: Responses from the external RxNorm API are cached to improve performance and reduce redundant calls.

Validation & Error Handling: Robust validation for incoming requests and proper error handling.
